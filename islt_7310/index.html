<h3> Hello and welcome to my professional website! </h3>

<p>My name is Alexis Smith. I am a 28 year old educator living and working in the Central
Arkansas area. I earned a bachelor’s degree in English language and literature in 2015, and am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Learning Technologies. I earned my educators license in 2016 and have been teaching in a secondary-level environment for the past 4 years; I’ve taught English I for 3 years and am currently teaching English III. Recently, I have been appointed the head coach for my school’s esports team, and have started leading training and professional development sessions for my colleagues. Along the way I have earned certifications such as: </p>
<ul>

easily adaptable. </p>
