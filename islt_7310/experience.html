While I've held a variety of positions, both professional and voluntary, over the years there are several that I consider to be high-points of my career. These following positions have been arguably the most challening, but have also been the most fulfilling and are a testament to my growth not only as an educator, but as a coach, a mentor, and as an individual as well.

<section id="section1">
<h3>Esports Head Coach</h3>
<ul>
<li> Jacksonville High School (Jacksonville, AR.)</li>
<li> August 2019 to present</li>
<li> Created the Jacksonville High School esports program, held try-outs, and created
two competitive teams. Organized &amp; participated in team building exercises;
oversaw all matches and practices.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Up until this year, my school district did not have an esports team. I decided to build
one for my school district; I wrote a proposal to go in front of the school board, and it was
accepted for the creation of the program. After it was created I coordinated try-outs for the
student body, organized fundraisers for the purchase of equipment, and have been single
handedly coaching two esports teams for both the fall 2019 and spring 2020 seasons. While I
feel extremely proud of my accomplishments this year, I have learned that there’s much more I
need to learn for next year’s season.

<h3>Mentor Teacher</h3>
<ul>
<li> Jacksonville High School (Jacksonville, AR.)</li>
<li> May 2019 to present</li>
<li> Lead multiple professional-development seminars over classroom management, educational routines, and educational technology resources</li>
    </ul>
<p>Becoming a mentor teacher was something that I did not expect, but has been an
extremely informative and enriching experience. I started out by doing small
professional-development seminars for my colleagues over pedagogical topics such as
classroom management strategies and graduated to leading professional development sessions
for the entirety of my school district. Recently I have found my “niche” in my school district:
teaching professional-development seminars over new educational technology resources and
their implementation in the classroom. This work has culminated in a new opportunities opening
up for me such as speaking at the Hot Springs Technology Institute (HSTI) 2020 summer conference.

<h3>Secondary Educator (English I &amp; English III)</h3>
<ul>
<li> Jacksonville High School (Jacksonville, AR.)</li>
<li> August 2016 to present</li>
<li> Taught students of varying abilities &amp; socioeconomic backgrounds</li>
    </ul>
<p>I'm lucky in the sense that I've always known what I wanted to do with my life, even at a young age: I wanted to be a teacher. It's been an incredible experience to go to work every day and live out my dream; I feel that this is one of the biggest strengths I bring to any classroom: I want to be there not only for the students, but also for myself. Every day I strive to not be just a teacher for my students, but also a mentor; a coach; their listening ear or shoulder to cry on; an adult in their lives that they could count on to be there for them despite the trials life may throw at them. Along with classroom rapport, I build relationships with parents and guardians, keep extensive records and data over student progress, and help create and implement English Language Arts curriculum that not only promotes project-based, real-world learning experiences, but also helps teach my students life lessons. Over the past four years in the classroom I've learned a lot, but still feel daunted by how much still there is for me to learn.
