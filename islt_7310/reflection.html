<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
    
    <p id="reflect1">My teaching philosophy can be simply boiled down into one concept: that everybody, no matter their background or circumstances, can learn and is entitled to a quality education. Consequently, I work every day to ensure that I live up to my own personal teaching philosophy and do whatever it takes to ensure that my students receive a quality education. Whether that be implementing multiple methods of instruction; staying late and arriving early to help tutor; differentiating instruction; or creating meaningful assignments; whatever it takes is what I will do. This communicates to my students not only that their education and future is important, but that they themselves are important. To be a good teacher is not just to teach the content, but to be there for the life lessons outside of your content area, and to communicate to your students that you'll simply be there for them.   </p>
        
    <p class="reflect2">As both an educator and a life-long learner, I believe that you never stop improving; this is an attitude I cultivate in my endeavors both in and out of the classroom. I have improved myself by pursing eduction both in the form of higher education, and through professional development and certification processes. However, instruction alone is not enough for improvement. Reflecting upon my teaching practices and receiving constructive criticism and feedback not only from administrators and colleagues but also from students is also an effective method I use to continually improve myself and my teaching methods. While the process of learning, refining my methods, and improving is never truly finished, it's something that as a life-long learner I continually enjoy.</p>

 <h3> Professional Reflection</h3>
        
        <p class="reflect2">Professionally, I plan to pursue higher education within the realm of education and technology, specifically addressing a problem plaguing families and school districts across the nation: insufficent internet access in a world that increasingly requires internet access for academic success. To this end after I earn my Master's Degree through the University of Missouri I hope to enter a program to pursue my doctorate in educational technology. By earning this education, I hope to become an advocate not just for my current community, but for other families that do not have the technological resources needed to succeed.</p>
