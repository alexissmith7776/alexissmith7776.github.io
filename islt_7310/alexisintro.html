    Hello, my name is Alexis Smith. I am a 28 year old English III teacher living and working in the Central Arkansas area; I’m taking this course as part of my degree requirements but have always been interested in learning how to code. I don’t have any previous web application or development training or experience, unless tweaking my MySpace page back in the day counts! I hope this course will give me the basics and the foundation I need in order to not only complete my master’s degree, but also to use these skills toward the development of educational games and classroom gamification methods. I have many hobbies in my free time, but I would have to say my favorite one is playing the ukulele. Other things I enjoy doing in my free time include playing Dungeons & Dragons, gardening, crocheting, and spending time with my two dogs, Apollo and Aethir.
